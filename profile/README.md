# SINTEF Optimization

This is the GitHub organization of the [Optimization group](https://www.sintef.no/en/digital/departments-new/applied-mathematics/optimization/) in [SINTEF Digital](https://www.sintef.no/en/digital/). We're a research group located in Oslo, Norway, that is always working on a broad range of research projects with industry actors. Our expertise is within the domain of operations research. More software will appear here over time, but we are already iteratively sharing a few projects that we have worked on. Check them out below!
